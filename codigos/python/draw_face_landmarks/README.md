# draw_face_landmarks

This is a ready to use solution to draw the face landmarks using Mediapipe.

First run will create three folders (if not created): images, metadata and results. Then you will be able to add some images to the images folder and run again. Results will be stored in the results folder. Metadata will contain the normalized landmarks coordinates in a text file with the same name that the image file.
